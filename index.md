Hello there, thanks for your visit :)

## About Me

I am currently a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the supervision of Prof. Li Lu. Back in 2020, I received my first B.Eng. in Electronic and Information Engineering (EIE) from UESTC and the second in Electronic and Electrical Engineering (EEE) from the University of Glasgow (UoG).

## Research Interests

I am self-motivated to work in the following research fields, contributing technical insight and system-level solutions.
- **Internet of Things:** architecture, low-power communication
- **Wireless Sensing:** integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)
- **Edge Intelligence:** cloud-edge collaborative inference
