Hello there, thanks for your visit :)

## About Me

I am currently a 5th year Ph.D. candidate in CS at the University of Electronic Science and Technology of China (UESTC), under the supervision of Prof. Li Lu. Back in 2020, I received my dual B.Eng. degrees in EE from UESTC and in EEE from the University of Glasgow (UofG).
<!-- I will be joining Harbin Institute of Technology (HIT) as a Tenure-Track Associate Research Fellow in early 2026. -->
